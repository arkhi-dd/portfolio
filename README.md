Hello! I am a Junior QA Engineer and I am eager to contribute to the quality assurance of software. Here's a quick look at some of my work:

## Test documentation
I have put together a testing checklist and a few test cases for a software application. This gives you an idea of my understanding of software requirements and my ability to design tests to validate functionality. [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-jZNM4JM4Lb_2HdE6CK2OoTU_w1bbUUNYhgAUl59YfU/edit?usp=sharing) you can find a checklist to testing challenge #1 and a few test cases for Discord.
## Postman
I have started exploring API testing by creating a [Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/avionics-technologist-94751529/workspace/portfolio/collection/18422328-16cf4f7f-3943-4a20-83cb-01f178eccaac?action=share&creator=18422328) using a Swagger documentation](https://petstore.swagger.io/#/).
## SQL queries
I have been working on improving my SQL skills by tackling various SQL practice problems. I have provided solutions to SQL questions at different levels, showing my problem-solving abilities and my developing proficiency in SQL.
Here are my solutions to [SQL Practice](https://www.sql-practice.com/):

- [Easy level](https://github.com/arkhi-dd/portfolio/blob/main/sql-practice/easy-level.md)

- [Medium level](https://github.com/arkhi-dd/portfolio/blob/main/sql-practice/medium-level.md)

- [Hard level](https://github.com/arkhi-dd/portfolio/blob/main/sql-practice/hard-level.md)


Overall, my portfolio is meant to give you a glimpse into my attention to detail, technical aptitude, and eagerness to learn and grow in the field of QA engineering. I am excited to continue developing my skills and making meaningful contributions to the quality assurance process.
